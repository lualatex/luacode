                    The luacode package for LuaLaTeX

DESCRIPTION


Installation
------------

Here are the recommended installation methods (preferred first).

1. If you are using TeX Live 2010 or later, use 'tlmgr install luatexbase'.
Alternatively, try your (TeX or Linux) distribution's package management system.

2. a. Grab luatextra.tds.zip on the CTAN.
   b. Unzip it at the root of one or your TDS trees.
   c. You may need to update some filename database after this, see your TeX
      distribution's manual for details. (Hint: with TeX Live, run 'mktexlsr';
      with MikTeX, look for "Refresh FNDB" in the MikTeX menu.)

3. a. Grab the sources from CTAN or github.
   b. Run 'make install TEXMFROOT=/path/to/texmf'.
      (Warning: 'make install' without giving a TEXMFROOT will
       put files in './texmf', which is probably not what you want.)
   c. See 2c.
